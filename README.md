# Hand-Sign-Detection-Application
The code can be used to construct a Detector object which will detect the hand sign for the letter Y <br>
Multiple neural networks are connected together in order to analyze images <br>
## Usage:
Run `training_data_collector.py` and `test_data_collector.py` to collect training and test data <br>
After that run `subnet_trainer.py` to generate a Network pickle <br>
If the accuracy is high enough, save the pickle by giving it a unique name and moving it to the `network_pickles` folder. <br>
Run `ensemble_training_data_collector.py` with the proper initialization of the variables. <br>
Run `intermediate_network_trainer.py` <br>
Rename and save the Network pickle. <br>
In `y_sign_detection.py` make sure the Detector is instantiated with the appropriate sub and intermediate Network objects. <br>
Run the script and it should return the final accuracy of the Detector. <br>
