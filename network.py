# This code is based off of mnielsen's work with the following modifications:
#   1. Python 3 compatibility
#   2. Implements a fully matrix based approach for each mini batch

"""
network.py
~~~~~~~~~~

A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning
algorithm for a feedforward neural network.  Gradients are calculated
using backpropagation.  Note that I have focused on making the code
simple, easily readable, and easily modifiable.  It is not optimized,
and omits many desirable features.
